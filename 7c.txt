A)Points in polygon analysis
The locations of all known significant earthquakes are given, we will try to find out which country 
has had the highest number of earthquakes.
Required dataset:
signif.txt ne_10m_admin_0_countries.zip
1.Open layer  Add Delimited Text layer and select “signif.txt”.
2.Chose Tab as File Format, as this is Tab delimited file. X and Y field will be auto populated.
 Click Ok. We may see some error message as some rows are not imported, but for this practical we can 
ignore this error.
3.Select WGS 84 as CRS.
4.The earthquake point layer is loaded in QGIS.
5.Now let’s add countries layer. Add vector layer “ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp”.
6.Click on Vector  Analysis Tools  Point in Polygon.
7.Select “ne_10m_admin_0_countries” and “signif” as Input polygon vector layer and Input point vector 
layer respectively, enter Output count field name as PNTCNT and give name of output file as “earthquake_per_country”.
 Click Ok. It may take 10-12 minutes for processing and then close it.
8.When asked whether you want to add the layer to TOC, click on Yes.
9.A new layer is added in layer pane. Right click on “earthquake_per_country” layer and click on Open Attribute Table…
10.In the attribute table we can see a column PNTCNT , this is the count of number of points from earthquakes layer
 that falls within each polygon.
11.We can sort the table by PNTCNT field and the country with highest count will be the answer. Click 2-times on the
 PNTCNT column to get it sorted in descending order. Click on the first row to select it and close the Attribute Table.
12.In the main QGIS window, we can see one feature is highlighted in yellow. This is the feature linked to the selected
 row in the attribute table which is having the highest number of points. Click on the Identify tool and click anywhere on
 layer in canvas to check attribute value at that location.
